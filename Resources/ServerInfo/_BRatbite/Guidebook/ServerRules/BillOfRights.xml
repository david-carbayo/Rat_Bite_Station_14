# NANOTRASEN STATION BILL OF RIGHTS

Violating the NT bill of rights is a Moderate crime in space law.

Definitions for station crew, passengers/visitors, robots, AI, other proto sapient beings, prisoners, and stowaways can be found BELOW the bill of rights on this document.

As with all of space law, it is a corporate mandate, so those at the level of Centcomm Official or higher on the Nanotrasen chain of command may make special exceptions at will.


# The Bill of Rights
Upon the signing of this NT station bill of rights into space law:
Departmentally Employed Station Crew are granted the following exclusive rights and privileges:

### 1: The right to free speech:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee, are provided the protected right to freedom of expression. This does not extend to harassment, threatening language or behavior, bigotry, or vandalism. (cleaning the station floor of unapproved messages or artwork is not a violation) No party may detain, assault, threaten demotion, or otherwise leverage force to silence your individual right to free speech.

### 2:The right to adequate medical care:
The medical department, or anyone else taking responsibility for your healthcare, must ensure you are not bleeding, and that your status monitor reads at least “Okay” to the best of their ability. Despite not qualifying for NT health insurance, those who are legally detained, or not employed under NT, are generously expected to be kept alive and out of a critical state at the very least.

### 3: The right to personal protection/self defense measures:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee, are provided the right to self defense and the implements required to defend oneself from hostile influences. 2A:This does NOT apply to items explicitly designated as contraband, chemicals capable of putting one into a critical (or worse) state with 15u or less, or weapons of mass destruction yet to be labelled as contraband.
This right to self defense does not extend to pursuing criminals/hostile entities past the point of two hallways distance, or outside of your department. At this point, you are expected to call station security.



### 4: The right to personal property:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee, have a right to the items stored on your person. In the event you are detained and these items are forcibly removed from you, they must be returned. An exception applies if/when incompetency/dangerous behavior is displayed/known of and the relevant item could exacerbate the impact of said behavior. An exception also applies if the item was initially stolen from anyone/anywhere else to begin with. This right does not extend to contraband or other items listed in NT Bill of Rights 2A.

This right also includes the right to give one’s departmental items to others. Despite it being understood that not every departmental trade/gift will be documented. In the event of a dispute, it is expected that you have stamped/signed approval in writing, if you do NOT possess said documentation, the one who received said departmental item must surrender it to the rightful department on request from said department until written approval is gained.


### 5: The right against bigoted discrimination:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee, are provided protection against bigotry on the basis of species, gender/gender conformity, sexual/romantic orientation, race, unique mutation, religious practice, or any other protected characteristic. No party may discriminate against you in providing departmental services or in hiring practices on the basis of the characteristics described, and no party may discriminate against you via targeted insults, bigoted exclusion, or other bill of rights violations on the basis of the characteristics described.


---
Departmentally Employed Station Crew AS WELL AS Passengers/Visitors and any other PDA carrying dwellers of the station are granted the below rights:

### 6: The right to space law’s protections:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee, registered visitor/passenger, or benign unregistered visitor seeking registration/station ID are provided to the protections granted by space law, those violating this right will not receive a bill of rights violation charge but instead the relevant charges in space law.

### 7: The right to personal dignity:
You, as a Nanotrasen employee or registered visitor/passenger, are provided the right to your own personal dignity. No party may strip you of your clothing, radio, or PDA (exception granted when any of these is contraband, or is used in ways violating space law.) No party may expose or fabricate sensitive (within the bounds of space law) details about your individual character/actions. No party may forcefully implant you with mental shielding unless permitted by space law. Exceptions to all of these rulings are granted with approval of the offended party, SoP approval, or requirement due to emergency.

### 8: The right against unlawful search and seizure:
The security department, or any other station crew, are not to (without clear, inarguable permission) search your individual person unless their SoP directly permits them to via probable cause or station alert being set to blue or higher.
The security department, or any other station crew, are not to (without clear permission) search your department/dorm/personal residence without access to said location, probable cause indicating that illegal items have been stored there, a warrant stamped by the Captain/HoS, or station alert level of blue or higher.

# Definitions, “What is ‘crew’?”

## Station Crew
Our honored crew, those who dedicate themselves in one way or another to serving NT corporate interests. First of all, thank you! But right to business, who ARE you? And what rights are guaranteed to you by NT!

The station's crew is defined as anyone employed in one of our departments, from the lowliest technical assistant all the way up to the station's captain or CC representatives! They will carry a pda with their department's access and job's logo proudly displayed. You are not immediately non-crew if you lose said pda/card. Anyone can become station crew through promotion via the HoP's idcard computer, always remember to set the icon, as this is what determines one's role in law.

Only those granted their IDs through officiated NT hiring practices (pre shift assignment, HoP approved hiring, CC approved hiring, or relevant departmental head hiring) count as crew as far as this bill of rights is concerned.

Unless otherwise specified in this document, anyone fitting this description is to be granted full space law protection as a member of the crew, as well as the rights defined in the Bill of Rights above.

## PASSENGERS AND VISITORS

Though they are widely known for criminal activities, Nanotrasen believes this is only due to their exceptional hiring practices making them look bad in comparison, and prides itself on its welcoming of refugees, visitors, traders, and job seekers all across the sector onto our stations!

A passenger/visitor is anyone possessing a pda and id, but not employed in any of our station departments.  They can be identified by their gray ID card icons.

They are considered crew as far as space law and silicon laws are concerned, but are granted a more limited bill of rights as seen above.


## Robots, Artificial Intelligence, and Proto Sapient Beings

This includes the following and NOTHING MORE:
Monkeys,
Kobolds,
Cyborgs,
Station AI,
Goblins,
Yowie,
Animals gaining sentience,
Station equipment/furniture gaining sentience,
PAIs/Persona weapons

By default, animals, robots, cyborgs and other proto sapients are considered property of whatever department they call their own, or otherwise property of anyone with a HoP stamped bill of ownership signed to them, with the bill taking precedence. This applies even if they gain the ability to speak/articulate. They are provided minimal protection from space law, their abuse being considered vandalism/destruction or animal abuse contextually.

The ONLY exception is if one of these beings is promoted to a member of command, CC, or security with appropriate mindshield. Then they attain full crew status with space law and bill of rights protections. The station AI is NOT considered as command or security.

## Prisoners
Prisoners are detainees rightfully locked into a NT brig. Until their sentence is served, their only rights are those defined in the main space law document.

## Illegal Stowaways
Anyone lacking an ID of their own fault and not making attempts to go find their's/get a replacement from the HoP is considered a stowaway and their rights can be compared to that of a foreign invader. If there is a reason for lacking ID or they are attempting to get one, they are considered at the very least as a passenger and usually should be considered as their role before losing ID.
